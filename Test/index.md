# Overview
Extends gameplay via progression in different weapon types and optionally adds extra spell slots to unarmed. Progress in expertise per weapon is earned from kills made by the player while that weapon is equipped. Players may choose extra stats to receive bonuses in per weapon, and this bonus scales with their level of expertise in the weapon.
